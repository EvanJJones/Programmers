I have an array of objects, I need to create an array with just the names

in process create new array to hold names and exit
for loop that loops through team.programmers and adds their name to other array
after loop add exit to array

inquirer based on new array
if exit is picked end
else print info from object matching name
loop to find object that matches name and call print function to that
call inquirer function again
